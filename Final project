The fact that men and women differ from each other is generally known. However, do they also differ in the use of language? Particularly when we look at the use of swear words? The use of swearwords is something which has not necessarily a positive impact on the population. Especially when used online, because it is there permanently. To prevent this negative influence we need to look at the source of the problem. Is this problem due to men or women? Or maybe the both have as much weight in this situation. 

Some background research

abstract = {The research on sex differences in terms of the use of strong swear words show that males have the inclination to utter strong swear words and to display aggressive actions more than females. Correspondingly, recent discoveries stress that females have larger volumes of orbital frontal cortex that modulates anger and aggressiveness created by the amygdala which might be related to sex differences in the use of strong swear words. Based on these findings, this study explores what kind of environmental and social pressures might have fashioned strongly swearing aggressive males during the course of human evolutionary history and examines the evolution of swearing by discussing the possible factors that might have prompted its emergence in our evolutionary background.}

My research question is: "Does the amount of using the swear words: 'fuck', 'shit' and 'bitch' differ between man and women on twitter?". Based on earlier research, I expect that it is not the case wether men or women use more swear words, however that it depends on the swear word itself. I think there are certain swear words used more often by women and other swear words more used by men.
